# alpha-bleeder
A tool that "bleeds" the alpha of an image out into transparent pixels. This stops artifacts from appearing when the image is resized.

Other tools that do this:

* [This GIMP plugin](http://gimpchat.com/viewtopic.php?t=3153)
* [urraka/alpha-bleeding](https://github.com/urraka/alpha-bleeding)
* I'm sure there are others!
